# Abbot FreeStyle Libre flash glucose meter Parser/Viewer

## Objective

Create a library to read and manage TSV files created by the FreeStyle libre app to better understand and visualize the report data

## How to install

`npm install`

## How to use the Viewer (user)

Mount a local web-server (for example using node's `http-server`) and browse to the `index.html` (for example http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html) to open the main view that lets you import a tsv file generated from the Abbott FreeStyle Libre app (or use the test.tsv example file) and visualize the data in the HighChart chart.

There are two viewer examples, one using highcharts (more complete) and another using Chart.js (more basic).

## How to use the FreeStyleLibreLib (developer)

```javascript
var reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsText(file);
reader.onload = function() {
    var report = FreeStyleLibreLib.parseReport(reader.result);
}
```

## TSV File Format (Tab separated values, like a CSV but with tabs)
This is the format of the exported file generated by the Abbot FreeStyle Libre app when running the `File->Export Data` menu option with the meter connected.

- Line 1:
    - Patient name
        - **this non-standard tsv line, break standard parsers**
        - **(Is this line optional?)**
- Line 2:
    - Headers
        - ID
        - Time **(Is YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm the only possible date format?)**
        - Record Type
            - 0: Historic Glucose
            - 1: Scan Glucose
            - 2: **?**
            - 3: **?**
            - 4: Insulin (Need to read if Rapid-Acting Insulin (units) or Long-Acting Insulin (units) has data to know witch is witch, probably appies to the "non numeric" ones too, but is not tested)
            - 5: Food
            - 6: Date change (Not implemented)
            - **Is there anything beyond type 6?**
        - Historic Glucose (mmol/L)
            - **Does the column name change if the meter units are not mmol/L?**
        - Scan Glucose (mmol/L)
            - **Does the column name change if the meter units are not mmol/L?**
        - Non-numeric Rapid-Acting Insulin
        - Rapid-Acting Insulin (units)
        - Non-numeric Food
        - Carbohydrates (grams)
        - Non-numeric Long-Acting Insulin
        - Long-Acting Insulin (units)
        - Notes
        - Strip Glucose (mmol/L)
            - **Does the column name change if the meter units are not mmol/L?**
        - Ketone (mmol/L)
            - **Does the column name change if the meter units are not mmol/L?**
        - Meal Insulin (units)
        - Correction Insulin (units)
            - **It seems that this is not used for insulin units**
        - User Change Insulin (units)
            - **It seems that this is not used for insulin units**
        - Previous Time
            - **For Record type 6**
        - Updated Time
            - **For Record type 6**
        - **Are these all the possible columns?**
        - **Can the columns have another name if the meter or app is set up in other language?**
